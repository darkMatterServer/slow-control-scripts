There are three folders in this repository: 

 - Arduino_Code
 - Debug
 - System_Control

Arduino_Code contains various arduino programs that one should be able to access and modify outside the lab
Debug contains test scripts that can be used to control and verify that components are working correctly
System_Control contains scripts to interact with various lab instruments, which will work in conjunction with slowcontrol, from _Princeton's Dark Matter Detector Lab_
